## Analyzing Employee Trends  

### Project Description  
This project focused on conducting an in-depth analysis of HR employee data to uncover key insights and workforce patterns. The dataset included information on employees from various departments, covering demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, attrition status, and more.

I applied SQL to explore the dataset and answer important business questions to generate actionable insights.

### Tasks Performed  
- Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the HR dataset  
- Wrote SQL queries to examine employee counts, averages, and distributions across dimensions such as department, age, education, etc.  
- Identified the most common job roles and assessed satisfaction levels by department to understand internal trends  
- Calculated attrition rates across different age bands to detect high-risk groups  
- Analyzed possible factors influencing attrition, such as age, education level, and job satisfaction  
- Compared key metrics and aggregates across employee segments to highlight differences  
- Identified high-performing and low-performing groups based on metrics like satisfaction and attrition  
- Utilized SQL concepts such as GROUP BY, HAVING, and CASE statements for advanced analysis  
- Structured and presented insights in a clear, concise manner suitable for leadership review
